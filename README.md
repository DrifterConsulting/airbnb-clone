Web application for booking rooms.

A user of the application may be a host, a guest or he/she may remain anonymous. Each host manages several rooms (photos,
availability, services) so that a guest that navigates the website can decide which one matches his/her preferences. A user
needs to has a personal account so that he/she can rent a room.

In the application, there is also an administrator that manages the users' requests to become hosts and can export xml files 
that contains current statistics (houses, dates, users).

Lsh (locality sensitive hashing) algorithm is used to suggest accomodation depending the reviews and history of the current
user.
